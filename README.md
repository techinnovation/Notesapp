# Notesapp
This is a mini MOOC
NotesApp is a Mini MOOC application that allows lecturers and student to share resources and notes. This is a quick way for lecturer to share informations as well as new note with the student. The wep application is notesapp.org.

Lecturers can independently sign up, while students can sign up as well. The lecturer can now add students to a particular course. This allows the student to get a notification alert when a new note is added to the course. 

The student can download the notes or read those notes online.
